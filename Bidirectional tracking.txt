Bidirectional tracking:

Forward from the earlier point

Backwards from the later point

Join the tracks at the midpoint
    The midpoint is at the frame where the forward tracking result and the
    backward tracking result are closest (in distance)

The resulting trajectory is
    Points from forward tracking, up to and including the midpoint frame
    Points from backward tracking, after the midpoint frame
